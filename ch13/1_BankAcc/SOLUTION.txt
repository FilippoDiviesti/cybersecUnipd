First i analyzed the code with ida64 and i noticed that there isa an if that chack 
your pin wita another one generated randomly. So you can know the pin. Then i used 
radare2 and i overwrited two bytes instead of the if statement. 
Then I restarted the program and now whatever pin i insert in the program it will
return me my bank account.
