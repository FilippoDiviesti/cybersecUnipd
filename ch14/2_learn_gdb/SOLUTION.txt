First i run the program and i saw that it decrypt the flag and save it into a global variable.
So i used gdb to instert a breakpoint after the decryption and using the command p and casting it to a char sequence i get the flag.

gdb run
[ctrl+x a] //tengo premuto ctrl e premo in sequenza x e poi a
b *main+70
r
p (char*)flag_buf
[ctrl+x a]
