SOLUZIONE 1 (RADARE2) :

First i analized the code with ida64 and i noticed that in the program also if you insert the correct username (john galt) and password (more-secure-password) you will never get the flag printed.
So using radare2, next to the function witch call the printWelcome function i insered a jmp command witch jump to the adress of the printFlag function.
Now if you run the program you will get the function printed.

SOLUZIUONE 2 (GDB) :

First i analized the code with ida64 and i noticed that in the program also if you insert the correct username (john galt) and password (more-secure-password) you will never get the flag printed. So i run the program using gdb and first i added a breakpoint at main+169 address before reading the user input then i run the program and it stopped at that point. Then i use jmp printFlag command and i got the flag.

gdb funmail
disass main
layout asm
b *main+169
r
jump printFlag
