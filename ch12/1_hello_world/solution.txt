First i opened the hellow_world file with ida64 and i saw the assembly
code of the main section of the program. Analizing the code i noticed
that the 4 alpha numeric code is checked by comparing char by char
and if a char resoult wrong it will return the error.
So i was able to read the chars i have to insert in the program and
tha flag appeared.

In alternative..

I was able to see the function that is called if the alpha numeric
code is right and ispecting the function you can see the flag that
will be printed.
